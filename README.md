## Demo
Take a look at live version: https://anmol-26.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/

## Features
1) Colored representation of step being executed.
  1.1) Blue:default
  1.2) Yellow: Being compared
  1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
  1.4) Green: In correct position
2) 3 Controls for visualizations
  2.1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
  2.2) Data size ()
  2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
4) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
This project currently supports the following sorting algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort
   
## Getting Started
To get started with this Sorting Visualizer project, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Start the development server.

## Usage
- Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Adjust the array size and sorting speed as desired.
- Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new random array.
- You can also step through the sorting process or run it automatically.
